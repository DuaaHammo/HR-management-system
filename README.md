## Overview
The HR Management System is a web-based application designed to help companies manage their employees effectively. It provides a platform to organize employee information and allows for easy filtering and retrieval of data.

## Features
- **Employee Information:** The system allows users to store and manage essential employee details such as employee ID, full name, department, level, image URL, and salary.
- **Employee Listing:** Users can view a list of all employees along with their respective salaries. The list is dynamically generated and can be sorted based on different criteria.
- **Unique Employee ID:** The system generates a unique four-digit employee ID for each new employee added to the system.
- **Salary Calculation:** The system calculates the salary for each employee based on their level. The salary range for each level is predefined, and a random salary within that range is assigned to each employee. The net salary is calculated after deducting the tax amount.
- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Navigation:** The application provides a navigation header that allows users to switch between different pages, such as the home page and the accounting page.
- **Social Media Integration:** The footer section includes links to the company's social media profiles, allowing users to connect and engage with the organization.

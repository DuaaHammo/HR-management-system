# HR-management-system
To enhance the HR management system, we will replace all object literals with a single constructor function called "Employee". This will allow us to create employee objects more efficiently and manage their information consistently.

The constructor function "Employee" will have parameters for the employee's image URL, ID, full name, department, level, and salary. Inside the constructor, we will assign these parameters to the corresponding properties of the created object using the "this" keyword.

To improve the user interface, we will refactor the render prototype method. This method will now generate separate cards on the home page to display each employee's information. Each card will include the employee's image, ID, full name, department, level, and salary.

By implementing these changes, we can achieve better code organization and a more user-friendly display of employee information on the HR management system's home page.
